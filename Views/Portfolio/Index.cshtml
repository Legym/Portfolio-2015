            <span>BreatheDotA.com </span> was the first website I built. Used a C# CMS called Umbraco. It was going to use Affiliated marketing, Newsletter signups, advertising, and is completed 100% custom made. Missing a lot of functionaility everywhere but that article. </p>

        <p>
            <span>Mygelb.com </span>Is my lastest edition. No CMS, but completely handmade. No themed or template used.

            <span>CounterStrike Template</span> Client wanted to convert a PSD document. Built within 3 hours.
